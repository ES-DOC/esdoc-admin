ES-DOC Stack v0.9.2.0 - Change log
=================================================================

-- Changed the API to index CIM Document Sets as a unit. CMIP5 records are bundled as CIM Document Sets that contain several documents (e.g. Grid, Model Component, Experiment, Simulation etc.). Indexing these as a bundle simplifies the code base and allows the Viewer to also handle Document Sets.

-- Enabled pyesdoc to decode both standalone CMIP5 Experiment Documents and Experiment Documents that are bundled with each CMIP5 Simulation. These documents present the Experiment information in an inconsistent way.

-- Fixed CMIP5 Model Component Property rendering in the Comparator. The Comparator was displaying multiple, erroneous values because it was incorrectly joining Model Component Properties with the set of all possible values.

-- Enabled the Viewer to render the full CMIP5 CIM Document Set. Users can now invoke one CMIP5 Document Set and navigate between Model Component, Grid, Experiment, Simulation, Platform, and Ensemble Documents.

-- Created an Ensemble tab in the Viewer to display the Ensemble information associated with a CMIP5 document.

-- Fixed the rendering of CMIP5 External URLs from within the Viewer. External URLs are used throughout CMIP5 to link to journal articles.

-- Fixed the rendering of CMIP5 Simulation Documents from within the Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF) data archive.  A typo in the API was fixed during the Viewer refactoring.

-- Ensured that the Comparator’s display of CMIP5 missing metadata (indicated by three question marks) is correct. This was accomplished by comparing a random set of raw CMIP5 documents to what was rendered in the Comparator.

-- Fixed the Viewer so that it renders in Internet Explorer version 0.8 and lower.

-- Converted the Viewer to be a standalone HTML application not reliant upon JavaScript. This allows the Viewer to be opened as a link and reduced the size and and complexity of the code base.

-- Changed the Viewer to use pyesdoc as a rendering engine instead of JavaScript. This was required for organizations using pyesdoc to both create and test render CIM documents.

-- Enabled the Viewer demo page to ingest static documents. This is required for testing end-to-end development.

-- Refactored the Viewer demo page look and feel. The demo page is now more inline with other ES-DOC tools, which creates a more uniform user experience.

-- Changed the API to use pyesdoc when indexing CIM documents.  This was the first step in migrating the Community Archive away from an external database.

-- Extended pyesdoc to generate a local copy of the Community Archive from various project Atom feeds. The API now uses this feature to index and store all registered CIM Documents, which is part of the migration away from an external database.

-- Changed the API to pull CIM Documents from pyesdoc’s CIM Document Index instead of a Postgres database. This significantly speeds up document rendering since database queries are slower by nature than pulling information from virtual memory.

-- Added the ES-DOC support email to all web pages. This makes it easier for users to contact support with questions or suggestions for improvement.

-- Extended the API to enable groups to search for CIM Documents from their own websites instead of navigating to the ES-DOC Archive. Documentation for this feature can be found at: https://github.com/ES-DOC/esdoc-api/wiki/API-Documentation.

-- Enabled the API to return error codes and responses. This feature was previously disabled for security reasons, but has been enabled at the request of several users.

-- Moved static resources (e.g. JavaScript code) to a dedicated endpoint. Previously, these resources were hosted within the API itself, which meant that any change in the documents required the API to be redeployed.

-- Documented the Shell. Documentation can be found at: https://github.com/ES-DOC/esdoc-shell/wiki.

-- Documented the API. Documentation can be found at: https://github.com/ES-DOC/esdoc-api/wiki/API-Documentation.

-- Upgraded the API to the Tornado web framework. Switching simplifies and reduces the code base by natively supporting the websocket protocol. This also allows for the creation of realtime publishing applications.

-- Enabled pyesdoc to validate CIM date ranges, number ranges, and regular expressions. This continues the work of enabling pyesdoc to validate the CIM Documents it generates.

-- Created a new API endpoint to return project-specific glossary information. This enabled the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute (KNMI) to ingest CIM Document information into an impacts portal glossary.

-- Changed the Cross Origin Request Support (CORS) feature of the ES-DOC server to use a white-list of 3rd party domains that can access the API. Previously this was accomplished using a JSON-P approach, which was less secure.
